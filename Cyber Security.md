## Professional Statement
With over seven years of experience in IT support and systems administration, I am eager to transition into cybersecurity, where my strengths in network configuration, server management, and troubleshooting can directly support an organization's security objectives. My commitment to safeguarding sensitive data, maintaining regulatory compliance, and protecting systems from potential threats aligns with the core values of many organizations looking to strengthen their security posture. I am particularly drawn to cybersecurity for its pivotal role in securing critical assets and preventing cyberattacks, and I am confident that my skills will help organizations achieve their goals of resilience, confidentiality, and integrity. As I continue to grow and expand my knowledge in this field, I will ensure my contributions are aligned with the evolving security needs of the organizations I serve.

## Objective
I am transitioning into cybersecurity after seven years of experience in IT systems administration, server management, and network configuration. My goal is to apply my technical expertise in securing digital infrastructures, identifying vulnerabilities, and proactively preventing cyber threats to support the security goals of an organization.
